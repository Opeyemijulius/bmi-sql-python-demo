# ðŸ©º BMI Records Manager â€“ SQL + Python Mini Project

This project simulates a simple health tech scenario where patient BMI (Body Mass Index) records are calculated, stored, and queried using **Python**, **SQLite (SQL)**, and **Pandas** â€” all run inside a **Google Colab notebook**.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

I created this project to strengthen my skills in:

- Writing SQL commands inside Python
- Using in-memory SQLite databases
- Performing basic data operations (INSERT, SELECT)
- Calculating BMI using real-world logic
- Simulating database-driven healthcare scenarios

It's part of my preparation for software and data-focused co-op/internship opportunities, including the [Philips Software Engineering Co-op](https://www.careers.philips.com/global/en).

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to create and interact with a SQL database using Python
- How to insert patient records and calculate BMI using formulas
- How to retrieve, update, and display structured health data
- How to use `pandas` to visualize SQL results

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used and Future Improvements

- Python 3
- SQLite (via `sqlite3` library)
- Pandas
- Google Colab

1. Connect to a persistent SQLite file or cloud-based database

2. Add CRUD functions (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

3. Build a basic Streamlit web app interface

4. Add categorization (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
